    # Version plan:
    #
    # Keeping it at 0.0.1 while it is still in ali/vendor/gems.
    #
    # Break it out to a standalone repo with its own continuous
    # integration jobs and go to 0.0.2.
    #
    # Write a proper README.md and convert internal comments to Rdoc,
    # then go to 0.1.0.
    #
    # Open up the repo and solicit feedback from select "beta" exteral
    # users.  Incorporate their feedback before going to 0.2.0 or
    # higher.
    #
    VERSION = "0.0.1" # still under ali/vendor/gems, incomplete docs
  end
