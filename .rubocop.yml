# Broadly speaking, test code gets a pass for most of the Metrics family.
#
# IMO test code is not the place get pedantic about class length,
# method complexity, etc.  One should be encouraged to add more tests
# with minimal friction, not forced to make a hard choice between
# cutting tests or splitting up my test suites.

# I like this Metric in principle, but I don't like the default max of
# 15.
#
# Also, as per Metrics/ClassLength IMO this kind of limit should not
# apply to test code (I get up to 318 over there).
